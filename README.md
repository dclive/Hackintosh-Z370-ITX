# Hackintosh EFI Information for Asus-Z370-I WiFi OC100 (with Graphics Issues)



**Tested macOS**

* Sonoma 14.5 with OpenCore 1.0

**Hardware**

* Asus Z370-I WiFi (BIOS 3005)
* Intel i7-8700
* AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB  / AMD Radeon RX 5700 8GB 
* 64GB RAM PC3200
* 2TB WD 850X NVME (1 partition for MacOS, 1 partition for Windows 11)
* NR200P Case 
* No wifi functionality is reliable for me; Bluetooth works with a Mac-compliant BT NVME 'card'

**Working**

* Ethernet
* HDMI & DP & USB Audio (motherboard 3.5MM audio not tested)
* Sleep / Wake
* App Store, Time Machine
* USB port mapping is complete, resulting in iPhone/iPads charging at 2100 ma, and Apple Watch at 1000 ma.  If yours (iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch) doesn't show this rate in About This Mac / System Report / USB, then your USB mapping may not be working correctly.  Only USBA style ports are set up and tested; internal ports for the Aura RGB sync are enabled but could easily be disabled, as it appears to be useless in MacOS

**Untested**

* N/A

**Not Working**

* Sidecar (due to the use of iMacPro1,1 SMBIOS, this wonâ€™t work; can be fixed by flipping to iMac19,1 SMBIOS quite easily, but then AppleTV and other applications may not play as easily) 

**BIOS Settings**

* OS type: Other types

**Disabled**

* Fast Boot
* Launch CSM

**Enabled**

* Above 4G decoding
* VT-x 

**Next Steps - Required**

You will need to do the following: 

* Prepare a USB boot disk for MacOS installation.  The easiest way is on a real Mac, although gibMacOS may work for you as well.  To follow the much easier Real Mac path, read https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372 and follow the directions for Big Sur, including the terminal command to write the download to the USB stick.
* Download EFIAgent (https://github.com/headkaze/EFI-Agent) and mount the EFI partition for the USB stick you just made.  Using EFIAgent again, "open" the EFI partition so it shows on the Mac desktop.  Note that EFI partitions are typically GRAY in color in EFIAgent.  To find EFIAgent, locate the new icon in the upper right clock area that looks like a circular pie.  ![Screen Shot 2021-09-25 at 7 22 44 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4536776/134790066-27597b9e-a37f-47e0-87f5-d3ebbc2af59f.png)

 >>  Remember this process for any future EFI partitions you must mount; this is a common procedure.

* Copy the contents of the attached zipfile to the USB stick, so that your files look something like the picture:

* The EFI partition on the USB stick has an EFI folder in it, and inside of that folder, there are two subfolders, OC and Boot, each with files in them.  Make sure your EFI partition looks just like this once you've unzipped the zipfile. 

Technically, you are now done.  You should be able to boot MacOS using the USB stick, and install MacOS onto your SSD.  That said, I usually suggest configuring it a bit *before* you boot into MacOS for the first time with the right serials and ROM info: 

* Download OCAT https://github.com/ic005k/QtOpenCoreConfig and open it.  Read the tooltips showing what all the icons at the top do.  Update to the latest OCAT version by finding the update button on the left side of the window and updating.  Don't continue until you've done this. 
* Open your USB stick's config.plist by using OCAT's OPEN icon.
* In OCAT, notice the row of icons on the left side.  Go to "PI" on the row. 
* Let's generate a new serial.  Ensure, under the GENERIC tab, that for "SystemProductName" you have the iMacPro1,1.  Then click GENERATE right next to the iMacPro1,1 box.  Your serial numbers are now set up.

Now let's fix your MAC address (ROM) 

* [Mac: This only works if you used the USB stick to install MacOS already; assumes MacOS is installed on this motherboard] Go to the Mac's terminal, type in "ifconfig", and find "en0:", your ethernet adapter.  Find the line "ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" and write those numbers, without the :, into the ROM box.  
* [Using Windows, if Windows is installed on this motherboard] Go to Windows' commandline/powershell interface.  Type 'ipconfig /all' and find your ethernet adapter.  Find the line "Physical Address" with xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx letters to the right on that same line.  Key in those letters and numbers, without the -, in the ROM box. 
* [The easy way; untested] Click GENERATE immediately to the right of the ROM box. 
* Serialization and ROM setup is now complete.  Press the SAVE icon in OCAT and then quit OCAT. 
* Your USB stick is ready to use to boot your Mac and install MacOS.   However, before you log into any iCloud / AppleID accounts, check the numbers above using the Dortania guide: https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html

**Final Steps**

* Assuming no other issues, your setup should now be complete.  Restart, press F8 at the Asus boot screen so you can choose a boot disk, and boot from the USB stick (select the uEFI option if prompted).  You'll then be able to step through installation of MacOS.  Once setup is done, use EFIAgent to copy the USB stick's EFI folder, with your serial number modifications, to the SSD's EFI partition, and then you'll be able to boot from that disk (and you won't need the USB stick anymore, but keep it forever as a backup!). Do note:  Until you've copied the EFI folder from your USB stick to your SSD's EFI partition, you must continue to F12-boot into your USB stick before booting into MacOS.  Once you've copied the USB stick's EFI folder to the EFI partition on the SSD, then you'll no longer need to use the USB stick to boot.  
* You can clean up logs and logging / bootup, if you wish, once you have everything sorted.  Doritania's guide has a post-install cleanup section with good details on that. 
* If the resulting USB stick won't boot, a quick first-order check is to use OCAT to update OpenCore (check the tooltips and icons at the top of the window) on your USB stick, and then try booting again.  
* Otherwise, please leave comments/issues here. 

You can always use OCAT (OpenCore Aux Tools) to update to the latest OpenCore and the latest associated KEXTs.  OC100 is working fine with this setup.  https://github.com/dclive/Howto--Update-OpenCore-with-OCAT is my howto guide.
